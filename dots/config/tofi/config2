# Default config for tofi
#
# Copy this file to ~/.config/tofi/config and get customising!
#
# A complete reference of available options can be found in `man 5 tofi`.

#
### Fonts
#
	# Font to use, either a path to a font file or a name.
	#
	# If a path is given, tofi will startup much quicker, but any
	# characters not in the chosen font will fail to render.
	#
	# Otherwise, fonts are interpreted in Pango format.
	font = /usr/share/fonts/furamono/Fura%20Mono%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete.otf

	# Point size of text.
	font-size = 14

	# Perform font hinting. Only applies when a path to a font has been
	# specified via `font`. Disabling font hinting speeds up text
	# rendering appreciably, but will likely look poor at small font pixel
	# sizes.
	hint-font = false

#
### Colors
#
	# Window background
	background-color = #1e1e2ecc

	# Border outlines
	outline-color = #080800

	# Border
	border-color = #2257a080

	# Default text
	text-color = #CDD6F4

	# Selection text
	selection-color = #a6da95

	# Matching portion of selection text
	selection-match-color = #00000000

	# Selection background
	selection-background = #00000000

#
### Text layout
#
	# Prompt to display.
	prompt-text = ""

	# Extra horizontal padding between prompt and input.
	prompt-padding = 0

	# Maximum number of results to display.
	# If 0, tofi will draw as many results as it can fit in the window.
	num-results = 0

	# Spacing between results in pixels. Can be negative.
	result-spacing = 0

	# List results horizontally.
	horizontal = false

	# Minimum width of input in horizontal mode.
	min-input-width = 0

	# Extra horizontal padding of the selection background in pixels.
	selection-padding = 0

#
### Window layout
#
	# Width and height of the window. Can be pixels or a percentage.
	width = 700
	height = 400

	# Width of the border outlines in pixels.
	outline-width = 0

	# Width of the border in pixels.
	border-width = 0

	# Radius of window corners in pixels.
	corner-radius = 40

	# Padding between borders and text. Can be pixels or a percentage.
	padding-top = 10
	padding-bottom = 10
	padding-left = 10
	padding-right = 10

	# Whether to scale the window by the output's scale factor.
	scale = true

#
### Window positioning
#
	# The name of the output to appear on. An empty string will use the
	# default output chosen by the compositor.
	output = ""

	# Location on screen to anchor the window to.
	#
	# Supported values: top-left, top, top-right, right, bottom-right,
	# bottom, bottom-left, left, center.
	anchor = center

	# Window offset from edge of screen. Only has an effect when anchored
	# to the relevant edge. Can be pixels or a percentage.
	margin-top = 45
	margin-bottom = 20
	margin-left = 20
	margin-right = 20

#
### Behaviour
#
	# Hide the cursor.
	hide-cursor = false

	# Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
	history = true

	# Use fuzzy matching for searches.
	fuzzy-match = false

	# If true, require a match to allow a selection to be made. If false,
	# making a selection with no matches will print input to stdout.
	# In drun mode, this is always true.
	require-match = true

	# If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
	# Otherwise, just print the command line to stdout.
	drun-launch = false

	# Delay keyboard initialisation until after the first draw to screen.
	# This option is experimental, and will cause tofi to miss keypresses
	# for a short time after launch. The only reason to use this option is
	# performance on slow systems.
	late-keyboard-init = true

#
### Inclusion
#
	# Configs can be split between multiple files, and then included
	# within each other.
	# include = /path/to/config
